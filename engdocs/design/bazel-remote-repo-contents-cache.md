## Summary

Every CI lane starts a cold Bazel client, and that client spends 15-38 s in
loading and analysis before the first remote action runs. Most of that time
goes to fetching external repositories: copying ~280 Go modules and running
gazelle on them (`go_deps`), creating ~1650 npm repos, and extracting debs.
Bazel 9 has two features that could remove that time. Both write cache
entries from the client, and rbe-west's D2 policy allows action cache writes
from workers only.

| Feature | Verdict |
|---|---|
| **Remote repo contents cache** (`--experimental_remote_repo_contents_cache`) | **Recommended.** It halves lane analysis time. The prerequisites: Bazel 9.3.0, `--loading_phase_threads=64`, and a narrow write path. That write path is one writer identity, used only by main-push CI, whose action-cache writes go through a gate that admits repo-contents entries and nothing else. D2 stays unchanged for every other identity. |
| **Same cache backed by Google Cloud Storage** (GCS IAM + GitHub OIDC instead of the gate) | **Not feasible for the remote-execution lanes.** The repo contents cache has no endpoint of its own: it uses the single `--remote_cache`. Bazel refuses an HTTP cache (GCS) next to a gRPC executor. Even where it works (local-execution runs only), it would cost about $0.05 per cold lane in egress and requests, and add latency. See [GCS as the backend](#alternative-google-cloud-storage-as-the-backend). |
| **Skycache** (`--experimental_remote_analysis_cache*`) | **Not possible in OSS Bazel.** Bazel 9.2.0, 9.3.0 and master ship only an in-memory backend, and `--experimental_remote_analysis_cache` is never read. Its entries also could not be verified (see below). Do not pursue it. |

Measured on Blacksmith runners (the lanes' own runner sizes), with the
`analysisPhaseTimeInMs` value that CI analytics reports:

| Lane (runner) | Main today (last 4 push runs) | Prototype, as-is (9.2.0) | Prototype, 9.3.0 + repo contents cache + `--loading_phase_threads=64` (3 runs) |
|---|---|---|---|
| unit (8 vCPU) | 16.1-28.1 s | 24.5 s | **10.1-10.5 s** |
| acceptance (8 vCPU) | 15.0-20.6 s | 14.3 s | **9.1-9.4 s** |
| integration-packages (4 vCPU) | 25.1-38.3 s | 29.2 s | **14.8-17.1 s** |
| integration-smoke (4 vCPU) | 23.5-34.3 s | 26.1 s | **11.7-13.4 s** |

The 8 vCPU lanes reach the ~10 s target. The 4 vCPU lanes halve, but stay
above it; on 8 vCPU they would land near 10 s.

## Background: where cold-client time goes

Each lane runs `bazel test --config=ci ...` on a fresh Blacksmith VM. Only
the content-addressed `--repository_cache` is restored from the runner
cache. The extracted repo contents cache is deliberately off (`--repo_contents_cache=`
in `setup-bazel/write-bazelrc.sh`): its extracted repos would come back from
the runner cache unverified. So every lane re-runs every repository rule:
extraction, `fetch_repo`, gazelle BUILD generation, npm repo creation.
ga-vnycm2.8 removed the network part (gazelle's tools come from the
repository cache) and moved the critical lanes to bigger runners. The rest
is CPU and I/O on the client.

## Skycache: not available, and not verifiable

### What exists in Bazel 9.2/9.3

- **Flags.** `RemoteAnalysisCachingOptions` defines
  `--experimental_remote_analysis_cache_mode=upload|download|dump_upload_manifest_only|off`,
  `--experimental_remote_analysis_cache` ("URL for the backend"),
  `--experimental_analysis_cache_service`,
  `--experimental_remote_analysis_write_proxy` (a
  `SkycacheStorageWriteProxyService`) and tuning knobs. Activation also
  needs `PROJECT.scl` active directories.
- **No persistent backend.** In OSS Bazel the services come from
  `SerializationModule.getAnalysisCachingServicesSupplier()`. In 9.2.0,
  9.3.0 and master, that method returns
  `InMemoryRemoteAnalysisCachingServicesSupplier`, an in-process
  `FingerprintValueStore` marked `// TODO: b/358347099 - use a persistent store`.
  No OSS code reads `remoteAnalysisCache`.
- **Google-internal protocols.** The storage, AnalysisCacheService and
  write-proxy protocols have no public server implementation. NativeLink
  implements none of them.
- **Cost of using it anyway.** We would need a forked Bazel binary with a
  custom `BlazeModule` and a backend we write ourselves.

### Why its entries could not be trusted anyway

- **Unverifiable values.** Skycache values are serialized Skyframe nodes:
  configured targets, actions, command lines and their keys. Nothing on the
  reader can check a value against its key without redoing the analysis it
  replaces.
- **Blast radius of one poisoned entry.** It injects an arbitrary action
  graph: any command, any test, any output, on every worker and every
  reader.
- **Untrusted input to an internal codec.** The bytes are deserialized by
  Bazel's internal codec registry, which was never designed for hostile
  input.
- **Not like the repo contents cache.** There, a poisoned entry can only
  substitute the source tree of one external repository (next section).

**Recommendation:** close the Skycache line. Revisit only if upstream ships an
OSS backend with an integrity story.

## Remote repo contents cache

### How it works (Bazel 9.2/9.3 source, `RemoteRepoContentsCacheImpl`)

- **Opt-in and eligibility.** `--experimental_remote_repo_contents_cache` is
  a startup option. Only *reproducible* repository rules are cached (those
  returning `repo_metadata(reproducible = True)`), and not `local` ones. In
  the prototype, all but 9-16 of the repos `//...` needs qualified (3690
  entries written).
- **Storage format.** A repo is stored as the ActionResult of a synthetic,
  never-executed action:
  - Command: one argument, a per-release UUID (9.2.0 `0336b325-...`, 9.3.0
    `06a53d89-...`).
  - Outputs: `.recorded_inputs` (the marker file) and `repo_contents` (the
    tree).
  - Input root: empty.
  - Salt: the repo's predeclared-inputs hash.
- **Rules that read inputs at fetch time.** These chain through
  *intermediate* entries whose stdout lists recorded inputs. The reader
  evaluates their current values and rolls the hash forward.
- **Cache hit.** Bazel downloads the marker and the Tree proto only, and
  injects the file metadata into an in-memory overlay filesystem. It reads
  file contents only when Bazel itself reads them (BUILD and .bzl files) or
  a *local* action needs them.
  - Remote actions get the files as inputs by digest. They are already in
    the farm's CAS, so they are never downloaded or uploaded.
  - In the prototype's remote-execution check, `rules_go`'s `go_sdk` (270 MB) was
    the largest repo materialized on the client. Most `go_deps` repos
    existed on disk only as `REPO.bazel`.
- **Gating.** Reads are gated by `--remote_accept_cached`. Writes are gated
  by `--remote_upload_local_results`, which CI sets to false, and by D2 on
  the server.

### Integrity: what is and is not self-verifying

- **Self-verifying.** The CAS blobs (file contents and the Tree proto) are
  content-addressed, and rbe-west's CAS is wrapped in
  `verify{verify_hash, verify_size}`.
- **Not self-verifying.** The mapping from key (predeclared hash) to Tree is
  an action-cache entry. A reader cannot check that the Tree is what the
  repo rule would produce without re-running the rule. That is the work the
  cache exists to skip.
  - `http_archive`'s sha256 covers the *archive*, not the extracted tree
    plus generated BUILD files.
  - `go_repository`'s `sum` covers the module zip, not gazelle's BUILD files.
- **Blast radius.** A malicious writer could map an honest key to a
  malicious tree, for example a Go module with an extra `init()`, or a
  BUILD file that adds a dependency. That tree would then be compiled into
  binaries and tests for every reader.
- **Compared with Skycache.** That is smaller than Skycache's blast radius,
  and it hits the same place a malicious upstream release would.
  - Entries can only be *source trees* for repos the reader already
    declared.
  - No reader deserializes anything beyond a marker file and a Tree proto.
- **Consequence.** The writer must be trusted. The design limits *who* can
  write, and *what* that writer can write.

### Write path design

```

1. **A writer identity used only by main-push CI.**
   - **Preferred (D14 in `rbe-unified-topology-design.md`).** The bazel.yml
     `rrc-seed` job trades its GitHub OIDC token for a short-lived client
     certificate `CN=rbe-rrc-writer,O=gascity`. The mint issues it only for
     these claims:
     - `repository == gastownhall/gascity` (and beads, with its own CN for
       audit);
     - `ref == refs/heads/main`;
     - `event_name == push`;
     - `job_workflow_ref == gastownhall/gascity/.github/workflows/bazel.yml@refs/heads/main`.

     PR, fork and Dependabot runs cannot obtain it. Fork runs get no OIDC
     token, and a same-repo PR's token carries `refs/pull/N/merge`.
   - **Stopgap.** A GitHub environment `rbe-rrc-writer` restricted to the
     `main` branch, holding a long-lived writer cert, revocable through
     `/etc/caddy/rbe-west/revoked.caddy`. It needs less server code, but the
     credential is long-lived.
2. **A gate that scopes the writer to repo-contents entries.**
   - `rrc-gate` is a ~250-line Go ActionCache front, prototyped on the infra
     branch `rbe/rrc-gate-prototype`, in `nativelink-cas/rrc-gate/`.
   - **Where it checks.** For each `UpdateActionResult`, it reads the Action
     named by the action digest from the verified CAS and re-checks the
     sha256 itself.
   - **What it admits.**
     - Action: empty input root, no platform, no timeout, cacheable, salted.
     - Command: exactly one UUID argument; output paths exactly
       `.recorded_inputs` and `repo_contents`; no environment.
     - ActionResult: either the final shape (that file plus that directory)
       or the intermediate shape (stdout only); exit 0; no symlinks; no
       stderr.
   - **Why it holds.** A real build or test action has a different Command,
     so its key cannot pass. Forging a real action's result would need a
     sha256 preimage. D2 ("only workers write execution results") therefore
     holds for every identity, the writer included.
   - **Release-proof.** The check is structural, so a Bazel release that
     rotates the UUID needs no gate change.
3. **Readers change nothing on the server.** Same-repo PR and main lanes
   already read `AC_OSS` with their existing certificates.
   - Fork lanes on instance `oss` (fork-rw) read it through the fork edge.
   - The anonymous rbe-cache could serve it read-only later.
4. **No test code runs with the writer credential.** `rrc-seed` runs
   `bazel build --nobuild` over the union of the lanes' target patterns,
   once per lane config. Only repository rules and Starlark from `main`
   execute there: gazelle, `fetch_repo`, pnpm-lock parsing, extraction. That
   is the same code every lane already runs on the runner.
5. **Audit.** Caddy's `rbe_west_ac_writes` log already records every
   `UpdateActionResult` with the certificate CN. The gate logs every
   admitted and refused write. `check_entries.py` audits an AC offline with
   the same rule.

**Residual risks (for owner decision)**

| # | Risk | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| R1 | A compromised `main` (a merged malicious PR, or a compromised BCR/Go/npm dependency that runs in a repo rule) poisons repo trees for every reader | The same compromise already controls what `main`'s lanes build. The new part is that the poison sits in the cache rather than in git. Mitigations: short-lived OIDC certs; the audit log; and a nightly `rrc-verify` job (follow-up). That job fetches cold with no cache and compares each repo's tree digest with the cached final entry. A mismatch means poisoning, or a rule falsely marked reproducible |
| R2 | A rule marked `reproducible` that is not (for example, it branches on host OS without recording it) serves a Linux tree to another host | Readers are Linux x86_64 CI lanes only. The startup flag goes in setup-bazel's CI rc, never in the committed `.bazelrc`. Developer machines and macOS/Windows jobs never read |
| R3 | Cross-repo sharing: gascity's writer can fill entries that beads reads (the same rule and attributes give the same key) | Both are gastownhall-owned main branches. Per-repo CNs keep the audit separable. If isolation is wanted, salt the keys per repo (not possible without a Bazel flag) or run a separate AC instance per repo (needs a scheduler instance per repo) |
| R4 | Bazel bugs in an experimental feature | #30218: a CAS blob missing during materialization fails the command, and the rule is not re-run. AC_OSS's `completeness_checking` already refuses entries with missing blobs at lookup time, and the CAS is large, so this is rare. CI's `--experimental_remote_cache_eviction_retries=0` makes it a visible lane failure. #31197: `--rewind_lost_inputs` crashes; CI does not use it. #31005: repos read by extensions are fully materialized; measured fine at 1 ms RTT. Fixed in 9.3.0: #30905 (serialized overlay reads), #31048 (cross-command invalidation), #30223 (local actions). Track #31456 (stabilization) |
| R5 | Server load: each cold lane read issues ~3700 AC lookups (completeness-checked) plus the Tree and BUILD/.bzl blob reads | About 18 CPU-s of NativeLink per cold unit-lane read (local NativeLink 1.7.1, filesystem stores). About 60-70 CPU-s per 4-lane PR run, in bursts. Watch core CPU during a canary |
| R6 | The cache is unreachable or slow | With an unreachable cache, the prototype fell back to fetching but took 467 s (per-repo retries). In CI the cache is the executor endpoint, so the lane is down anyway. At 100 ms RTT, reads take about 2x the 1 ms numbers |

### Client prerequisites (all key-neutral)

- **Bazel 9.3.0.** Under 9.2.0 the overlay filesystem serializes
  `getInputStream` (fixed by bazelbuild/bazel#30905, in 9.3.0). In the
  prototype on the shared cherry host, 9.2.0 with the cache took 128-130 s
  of analysis at 44 ms RTT against 32 s without it. 9.3.0 alone also helps:
  unit 24.5 s to 18.8 s.
- **`--loading_phase_threads=64`.** Each cache hit is several sequential
  round trips, and ~3700 repos are resolved through Skyframe's loading
  threads, which default to the CPU count. Without it, cached reads are
  *slower* than fetching: unit 27.1 s, integration-smoke 55.3 s. Without the
  cache, the flag changes nothing measurable (fetching is CPU-bound).
- **Key neutrality.** Neither flag changes action keys. In the prototype's
  remote-execution check, actions that ran with repo contents from the cache
  were all remote cache hits for a run without it (2693/2693). Both flags
  belong with the rc's transport flags (`scripts/bazel_key_parity_test.go`
  classification).

## Alternative: Google Cloud Storage as the backend

The question: back the repo contents cache with a GCS bucket, written only by
main-push CI and read by everyone else under GCS IAM with GitHub OIDC
Workload Identity Federation, and drop the rbe-west server change (gate,
writer certificate, Caddy route).

### Feasibility (Bazel 9.3.0)

- **No endpoint of its own.** `--experimental_remote_repo_contents_cache` is
  a startup *boolean* (`RemoteStartupOptions`). `RemoteRepoContentsCacheImpl`
  is handed the build's one `CombinedCache`, from
  `RemoteModule.initRepoHelpersAndOverlayFs`, via
  `actionContextProvider.getCombinedCache()`. That is the `--remote_cache`
  (plus `--disk_cache`). No flag points repo contents anywhere else.
- **The HTTP protocol works on its own.** `initHttpAndDiskCache` also calls
  `initRepoHelpersAndOverlayFs`. A GCS bucket used as Bazel's HTTP cache
  (`--remote_cache=https://storage.googleapis.com/<bucket>` with
  `--google_credentials` / `--google_default_credentials`) therefore works,
  *without remote execution*.
  - Verified with a local HTTP cache (the same GET/PUT `/ac/<sha>`,
    `/cas/<sha>` protocol GCS serves).
  - Seeding the unit lane took 119,705 PUTs (3.9 GB).
  - A cold read took 32,434 GETs (32,402 hits) and 311 MB, ran 8 repository
    rules, and analysed in 13.4 s on cherry.
- **Not with remote execution.** `RemoteModule.java` (9.3.0) rejects an HTTP
  cache next to a gRPC executor:
  `ERROR: Cannot combine gRPC based remote execution with HTTP-based caching`.
  Reproduced with `--remote_executor=grpc://… --remote_cache=http://…`.
  Every lane runs with rbe-west as its executor.
- **Not through a gRPC proxy either.** A separate gRPC `--remote_cache` in
  front of GCS would be accepted. But Bazel assumes the executor reads the
  same CAS. The repo files' contents would then live only in GCS, and remote
  actions would fail on inputs missing from rbe-west's CAS. The point of the
  feature under remote execution is that the tree is already in the
  executor's CAS.
- **No other route.**
  - A `--disk_cache` pre-filled from the bucket would mean downloading the
    whole 3.9 GB snapshot per lane.
  - A GCS slow tier under NativeLink keeps every write going through
    rbe-west, so the trust model is unchanged. It also uses a different
    object layout (`<hash>-<size>`, not Bazel's `ac/<hash>`).
- **What it would take.** A GCS-backed path for these lanes needs an upstream
  Bazel feature: a separate repo-contents cache endpoint. Even then, the
  client or rbe-west would have to copy the trees into rbe-west's CAS.

### Comparison (had it been feasible)

| | rbe-west + rrc-gate (recommended) | GCS bucket + IAM/WIF |
|---|---|---|
| Works with the remote-execution lanes | **Yes** (prototype, 2693 remote actions) | **No** (HTTP cache and gRPC remote execution are mutually exclusive in Bazel 9.3.0) |
| Server change on rbe-west | Gate unit, Caddy block, mint OIDC path | None |
| Trust: who writes | One OIDC-minted 30-min cert, main-push only, scoped by the gate to repo-contents entries; D2 intact | WIF provider with an attribute condition (`repository`, `ref == refs/heads/main`, `event_name == push`, `job_workflow_ref`) bound to `roles/storage.objectCreator`. Simpler to state, but GCS cannot check *what* is written. The bucket only ever holds this cache, so there is nothing else to forge. |
| Trust: who reads | Existing certificates; forks through rbe-cache (anonymous, read-only) later | `objectViewer` for CI's WIF principal; forks need `allUsers` read (public bucket) |
| Round trip from Blacksmith Phoenix | 1 ms (TCP connect, measured) | Network to us-west4 (Las Vegas) 16-20 ms and us-west2 18-20 ms (gcping, measured on the runners). A GCS object request measured 49-53 ms (US multi-region bucket, warm connection); a regional bucket would be lower, but needs a test bucket to measure |
| Unit lane analysis (8 vCPU, modelled with gRPC at that RTT) | 10.3 s | 11.1 s at 17 ms; 14.7-14.8 s at 51 ms (11.0 s with `--loading_phase_threads=256`) |
| Bytes per cold lane read | 311 MB (from rbe-west, no transfer fee) | 311 MB of GCS egress |
| Cost | No new spend (existing host and disk) | Storage about 4-20 GB, about $0.10-0.50/month. Per cold lane: 0.31 GB at about $0.12/GB internet egress, plus ~32k Class B ops at $0.0004/1k, so **about $0.05**. bazel.yml ran 1178 times in the last 14 days (gascity, about 4 lanes each), so about **$500/month** for gascity and about the same again for beads |
| Fork PRs | Read through the existing anonymous rbe-cache (to be enabled) | Public-read bucket; forks still could not combine it with the gRPC fork cache |
| Poisoning | The writer is trusted, and its scope is enforced by the gate | The writer is trusted. The scope is "this bucket" (contents not checked), plus object versioning and Data Access audit logs |
| Nightly verification (R1) | Cold fetch; compare tree digests with `GetActionResult` final entries | Same comparison, reading `ac/<key>` objects; versioning lets you diff and roll back |
| Operational burden | A small Go service plus Caddy config on a host we already run; the selftest and lint extend | A bucket, WIF pool and provider, IAM, a lifecycle rule (Terraform), billing and egress monitoring, and a second cloud dependency on the critical path |

Latency model, from the same Blacksmith run
(https://github.com/gastownhall/gascity/actions/runs/37979785470, gRPC
through the delay proxy):

- **unit (8 vCPU):**
  - 1 ms: 10.3 s
  - 17 ms: 11.1 s
  - 51 ms: 14.7 and 14.8 s
  - 51 ms with `--loading_phase_threads=256`: 11.0 s
  - cold, no cache: 16.9 s
- **integration-smoke (4 vCPU):** the runner was slow throughout that run
  (cold 37.4 s, against 22-24 s before), so the readings carry no signal:
  - 1 ms: 23.8 s
  - 16 ms: 21.0 s
  - 52 ms: 25.0 and 26.0 s

### Verdict on GCS

**Do not use GCS for the lanes.**

- Bazel 9.3.0 cannot serve repo contents from GCS to a build that executes
  on rbe-west.
- Even if it could, the trees would have to reach rbe-west's CAS anyway.
- It would add 1-4 s of analysis per lane and about $0.05 of egress per
  lane.

What GCS does buy, a write path with no rbe-west code, is real only for
local-execution clients, and those already read rbe-west's action cache
through `--remote_cache`. The rbe-west gate design stays the recommendation.

Revisit if upstream adds a separate endpoint for the repo contents cache.
bazelbuild/bazel#31456, the stabilization tracker, lists no such item today.

## Prototype and measurements

Everything ran against throwaway NativeLink 1.7.1 instances configured like
rbe-west's instance `oss`: a `verify` CAS and a `completeness_checking` AC.
**Nothing on rbe-west was written or reconfigured.**

1. **Blacksmith, per lane.** Branch `ci/bazel-rrc-proto`, workflow
   `rrc-proto.yml` (throwaway, never merged), run
   https://github.com/gastownhall/gascity/actions/runs/37967840371.
   - Setup:
     - NativeLink on the runner, behind a userspace delay proxy.
     - The real runner cache (`--repository_cache`, LLVM archive) restored
       as in bazel.yml.
     - A cold output base per run, `bazel test --nobuild` with each lane's
       command.
   - The runner's TCP connect RTT to `rbe-west.ops.gascity.com:443` was
     **1 ms**: Blacksmith and rbe-west are co-located. So "rttM" below is
     the real CI condition.

| Lane | 9.2.0 as-is | 9.3.0 | 9.3.0 + lpt64 | write (9.3.0) | read, lpt64, RTT 1 ms (x3) | read, no lpt64 | read, lpt64, RTT 0 | read, lpt64, RTT 100 ms |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| unit, 8 vCPU | 24.5 | 18.8 | 17.0 / 20.3 | 30.7 | 10.5 / 10.1 / 10.4 | 27.1 | 10.5 | 21.6 |
| acceptance, 8 vCPU | 14.3 | 15.5 | 13.2 / 15.4 | (hit) | 9.1 / 9.2 / 9.4 | 12.6 | 8.5 | 24.4 |
| integration-packages, 4 vCPU | 29.2 | 27.7 | 24.6 / 26.4 | 55.7 | 15.1 / 14.8 / 17.1 | 48.6 | 16.3 | 30.2 |
| integration-smoke, 4 vCPU | 26.1 | 23.8 | 23.5 / 22.1 | (hit) | 13.4 / 12.9 / 11.7 | 55.3 | 13.5 | 31.1 |

   Notes on the table:
   - All values are `analysisPhaseTimeInMs`, in seconds.
   - The full client command adds about 4-6 s (JVM start, module
     resolution, the non-reproducible `bazel_gazelle_go_repository_cache`
     at ~3 s, the python toolchain at ~1.5 s). Unit's wall time went from
     29.8 s to about 17 s.
   - Repository rules executed per read: 9-16, against 300-600 cold.
   - Writer cost: +11-28 s on the job that seeds. The CAS held 3.9 GB and
     the AC 3690 entries for unit plus acceptance; the other two lanes add
     almost nothing.

2. **Gate, end to end (cherry).** Bazel 9.3.0 wrote through Caddy and
   `rrc-gate` into a fresh NativeLink, mirroring the proposed route.
   - All 3690 repo-contents writes were admitted.
   - A locally executed genrule uploaded with `--remote_upload_local_results`
     was refused: `PERMISSION_DENIED: rrc-gate: not a repo contents cache entry: input root ... is not the empty directory`.
     The build still succeeded, with a warning.
   - A fresh reader then hit every entry: 12.5 s analysis, against ~32-39 s
     cold on the same host.
   - `go test` covers 13 refusal cases: input root, salt, timeout, command
     env/args, instance, absent action, exit code, extra or renamed outputs,
     symlinks, empty intermediate, stderr, and a blob that does not match
     its digest.
3. **Remote execution with cached repos (cherry, local NativeLink
   scheduler and worker).**
   - Command: `bazel test //internal/config:config //internal/citylayout:citylayout_test`
     with `--remote_download_minimal`.
   - 2693 remote actions ran on sources that never reached the client, and
     the test passed.
   - A run without the cache was then 2693/2693 remote cache hits
     (key parity).

## Rollout (each step needs owner approval; nothing here is deployed)

1. **Bazel 9.3.0 bump (gascity, then beads).**
   - Files: `.bazelversion`; the setup-bazel sha pin
     `9.3.0/amd64 d302d22e...`, arm64 from the release; a
     `MODULE.bazel.lock` refresh (9.3.0 rewrites it).
   - Has value on its own, and is a hard prerequisite.
   - Expect a cold action cache for one cycle if any builtin rule's command
     line changed.
2. **Server (rbe-west core). Owner deploys.**
   1. Writer identity. Preferred: an OIDC path in `rbe-fork-mint` (D14) for
      the claims above, issuing 30-minute `CN=rbe-rrc-writer,O=gascity`
      leaves (per repo: `rbe-rrc-writer-beads`). Stopgap: one leaf in a
      `main`-only GitHub environment.
   2. Build and install `rrc-gate` as a systemd unit:
      - user `rrc-gate`;
      - `127.0.0.1:50066`, `-ac 127.0.0.1:50056 -cas 127.0.0.1:50065 -instance oss`;
      - `ProtectSystem=strict`, no network but loopback.
   3. Caddyfile: a `@rrc_writer` subject block before `@oss_worker`'s
      fallthrough:
      - GetCapabilities to `:50053`;
      - CAS and ByteStream to `:50065`;
      - `/build.bazel.remote.execution.v2.ActionCache/*` to `:50066`;
      - everything else gRPC 7.

      Add it to `rbe_config_lint.py trusted-edge` and to the selftest. The
      selftest checks that a repo-contents write is admitted, a real action
      write is refused, and Execute is refused.
   4. Nothing else changes: no NativeLink config, no listener, no D2 rule
      for any other certificate.
   5. Rollback: delete the Caddy block (`systemctl reload caddy`) and stop
      the unit. Entries already written expire under AC_OSS's LRU. Readers
      fall back to fetching.
3. **CI (gascity PR).**
   - Add an `rrc-seed` job to `bazel.yml` on `push` to `main` (needs
     `id-token: write`). It runs `bazel build --nobuild` for each lane's
     config with `--remote_upload_local_results` and the writer cert, in
     parallel with the lanes.
   - setup-bazel's `write-bazelrc.sh` adds
     `startup --experimental_remote_repo_contents_cache` and
     `common --loading_phase_threads=64` in remote modes only.
   - Classify both in `bazel_key_parity_test.go`.
   - Canary first: add the flags to the unit lane only, compare analytics,
     then all lanes. Then beads.
4. **Follow-ups.**
   - `rrc-verify` nightly (R1).
   - Fork-rw and the anonymous cache as readers.
   - Making `bazel_gazelle_go_repository_cache` (~3 s, non-reproducible)
     cacheable or unnecessary.

Expected after steps 1-3, from the prototype:
- unit and acceptance analysis about 9-11 s;
- integration-packages and integration-smoke about 12-17 s on 4 vCPU.

That cuts about 5-15 s from every lane's critical path, on every PR.
